# Mokki Ski Trip Planning App - Business Review & Strategic Analysis
*Generated: December 8, 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

**Mokki** is a group-focused ski trip coordination platform that solves a real pain point: managing shared ski house logistics across multiple people. The app combines stay tracking, automatic guest fee calculation, weather/snow reporting, and group communication tools.

**Bottom Line Assessment:** ✅ **YES, there is monetizable value here** - but success depends on finding the right niche and executing a focused go-to-market strategy.

**Key Strengths:**
- Solves a genuine problem experienced by thousands of ski house groups
- Unique automatic guest fee calculation feature
- Strong technical foundation with modern stack
- Clear differentiation from generic trip planners

**Key Challenges:**
- Web-only limits adoption (groups want mobile)
- Competitive market with established players
- Limited network effects in current form
- Requires critical mass within groups to be valuable

---

## Market Opportunity Analysis

### Target Market Size

**Primary Market: Shared Ski House Groups**
- **Addressable Groups in North America:** ~50,000-100,000 active shared lease groups
- **Group Size Average:** 6-12 people
- **Annual Trips per Group:** 5-15 weekends
- **Total Potential Users:** 300,000-1,200,000 active ski enthusiasts

**Market Segments:**

1. **Core Segment (Highest Value):**
   - College alumni groups (25-45 years old, tech-savvy)
   - Seasonal house shares in Tahoe, Colorado, Utah, Vermont
   - 8-15 person groups with rotating attendance
   - Annual spending: $5,000-15,000 per person on ski trips
   - **Willingness to Pay:** HIGH (already spending thousands, $50-200/year for coordination is negligible)

2. **Secondary Segment:**
   - Corporate ski trip organizers
   - Ski clubs and meetup groups
   - Multi-family vacation coordinators
   - **Willingness to Pay:** MEDIUM (budget-conscious, may prefer free options)

3. **Aspirational Segment:**
   - Individual trip planning (lighter feature usage)
   - Day trip coordination
   - **Willingness to Pay:** LOW (limited value without group dynamics)

### Market Validation

**Pain Points You're Solving:**
1. ✅ "Who's coming this weekend?" (Stay Calendar)
2. ✅ "How much do guests owe?" (Automatic Guest Fees)
3. ✅ "Where should we ski tomorrow?" (Multi-Resort Weather)
4. ✅ "What's the WiFi password again?" (Bulletin Board)
5. ⏳ "Who owes what for groceries?" (Expenses - coming soon)
6. ⏳ "Did everyone see the group message?" (Chat - coming soon)

**Real-World Validation Needed:**
- Do groups currently use spreadsheets for this? (YES - anecdotally common)
- Would they switch from existing tools? (MAYBE - depends on friction)
- Will they pay for it? (DEPENDS - need to prove ROI)

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

**1. Splitwise**
- **Focus:** Expense splitting (general purpose)
- **Strength:** Network effects, established user base, mobile apps
- **Weakness:** Not ski-specific, no weather/calendar integration
- **Your Advantage:** Integrated ski-specific features (weather, guest fees, stay tracking)

**2. TripIt / Google Trips**
- **Focus:** Individual trip organization
- **Strength:** Broad travel use cases
- **Weakness:** Not group-focused, no expense splitting
- **Your Advantage:** Group coordination and shared house management

**3. WhatsApp/GroupMe + Google Sheets**
- **Focus:** DIY coordination
- **Strength:** Free, familiar, flexible
- **Weakness:** Fragmented (multiple tools), manual work, no automation
- **Your Advantage:** All-in-one platform, automatic guest fee calculation, integrated weather

**4. Airbnb/VRBO Group Tools**
- **Focus:** Booking and basic coordination
- **Strength:** Integrated with booking flow
- **Weakness:** Limited to their properties, no custom expense tracking
- **Your Advantage:** Works for any ski house (owned, leased, or rented)

### Indirect Competitors

- **Slack/Discord:** Group communication (but no trip-specific features)
- **Excel/Google Sheets:** Ultimate flexibility but high manual effort
- **Venmo/PayPal:** Payment but no coordination

### Competitive Positioning

**Mokki's Unique Position:** "The operating system for shared ski houses"

You're not competing with general travel apps or expense trackers. You're creating a **category** - ski house management software. Think:
- HomeAway : Vacation Rentals :: Mokki : Shared Ski Houses
- Slack : Work Teams :: Mokki : Ski House Groups

## Key Challenges & Risks

### 1. Network Effects Hurdle

**Problem:** App is only valuable if whole group uses it
**Mitigation:**
- Make onboarding frictionless (1-click invites)
- Offer value even for partial adoption (one person can track for group)
- Create incentives for inviting members (gamification, rewards)

### 2. Mobile-First World

**Problem:** Web-only limits adoption (people check on phones)
**Mitigation:**
- Build mobile PWA immediately (installable, offline-capable)
- Prioritize native mobile app (React Native for iOS/Android)
- Design mobile-first, then scale up for desktop

### 3. Seasonal Usage

**Problem:** Ski season is 5-6 months, app goes dormant in summer
**Mitigation:**
- Expand to multi-season (summer lake houses, beach houses)
- Add year-round features (trip planning for next season)
- Off-season engagement (gear sales, early bird weather)

### 4. Competitive Moat

**Problem:** Idea is easily replicable by larger players
**Mitigation:**
- Move fast, build loyal user base
- Focus on ski-specific depth (not breadth)
- Build community and brand (Mokki = ski house coordination)
- Establish resort partnerships early (exclusive data)

### 5. Customer Acquisition Cost

**Problem:** Expensive to reach niche ski house organizers
**Mitigation:**
- Leverage organic channels (Reddit, forums, word-of-mouth)
- Referral programs with strong incentives
- Partner with existing communities (ski clubs, forums)
- Content marketing to drive inbound

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### Priority 1: Complete the MVP (Next 3 Months)

**Critical Features to Finish:**
1. ✅ Expense tracking UI (80% of value is here)
2. ✅ Photo gallery (emotional connection, memory sharing)
3. ✅ Mobile PWA (installable web app for phone home screens)
4. 🔄 Chat (lower priority - WhatsApp is entrenched, consider deprioritizing)

**Why:** You can't monetize an incomplete product. Finish these before marketing.

---

### Priority 2: Validate with Real Users (Months 4-6)

**Target 10 Beta Houses:**
- Recruit from personal network (ask every friend with a ski house)
- Post in r/skiing: "Looking for beta testers for ski house coordination app"
- Offer free lifetime premium in exchange for weekly feedback

**What to Learn:**
- Which features do they use most?
- What's missing that they need?
- Would they pay? How much?
- Do they invite their whole group?

**Success Metric:** 5/10 houses actively using it weekly after 3 months

---

### Priority 3: Build Mobile Experience (Months 4-9)

**Options:**
1. **Mobile PWA (Quickest):** Make current web app installable on phones
   - Add service worker for offline access
   - Optimize for mobile layouts
   - Enable "Add to Home Screen"
   - **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks

2. **React Native App (Best Long-Term):** Build native iOS/Android apps
   - Reuse React components/logic
   - Better performance and native feel
   - App Store presence (discovery)
   - **Timeline:** 3-6 months

**Recommendation:** Do both - PWA first for immediate value, React Native in parallel.

---

### Priority 4: Decide on Monetization (Month 6)

**Before Launching Paid Tier, Answer:**
- What's the willingness to pay? (survey beta users)
- What price point feels fair? ($50/year? $100? $10/month?)
- Who pays - the organizer or each member?
- What features justify premium?

**Experiment with Pricing:**
- Test multiple price points with different beta groups
- Use landing page with pricing tiers (gauge interest before building)
- Grandfather early users at discounted rates

---

### Priority 5: Growth Loops (Months 7-12)

**Viral Loop:**
1. User invites house members →
2. Members see value, use regularly →
3. Members invite OTHER houses they're part of →
4. Repeat

**Make Sharing Easy:**
- One-click invite with pre-written message
- Social sharing for bulletin board posts
- Public weather reports (shareable links)
- "Powered by Mokki" branding on shared content

**Referral Incentives:**
- "Invite 3 houses, get free premium for a year"
- "Each friend who signs up adds 1 month of free premium"

---

## Differentiation Strategy: Where to Lean In

Based on your current features and market gaps, here are the **highest-leverage areas** to focus on:

### 🎯 Double Down On: Automatic Guest Fee Calculation

**Why:** This is your unique killer feature. No one else does this.

**How to Strengthen:**
- Make it more configurable (per-house rates, per-night vs. flat fee)
- Add automatic reminders for unpaid guest fees
- Integration with Venmo/PayPal for one-click settlement
- Beautiful visualizations (who owes what, historical trends)
- Guest fee leaderboard (who brings most guests - gamify it)

**Marketing Angle:** "Stop arguing about guest fees. Mokki calculates them automatically."

---

### 🎯 Double Down On: Multi-Resort Weather Intelligence

**Why:** Ski-specific weather is hard to find and valuable for decisions.

**How to Strengthen:**
- Powder alerts (email/SMS when >6" forecasted at favorite resorts)
- "Best conditions this weekend" recommendations
- Snow quality predictions (powder, packed, icy)
- Historical snow data (compare to last year)
- Webcam integration for real-time conditions
- Resort status (lifts open, terrain park status)

**Marketing Angle:** "Know where to ski before your friends do."

---

### 🎯 New Focus: Trip Memory & Photo Sharing

**Why:** Emotional connection drives retention and word-of-mouth.

**How to Build:**
- Photo gallery per trip (tag people, date, resort)
- "Trip highlights" feature (best moments from the season)
- End-of-season recap (total days, vertical feet, group stats)
- Shareable trip albums (public links for friends/family)
- Integration with Instagram/social (share to stories)

**Marketing Angle:** "Your ski house memories, all in one place."

---

### 🎯 New Focus: Expense Settlement Simplification

**Why:** Splitting expenses is painful. Make it effortless.

**How to Build:**
- Venmo/PayPal/Zelle integration (one-click payments)
- Smart expense splitting (by attendance, by guest count)
- Running balance (who owes who across all trips)
- Auto-reminders for unsettled expenses
- Expense export to CSV/PDF for taxes

**Marketing Angle:** "No more awkward Venmo requests. Mokki handles the math."

---

### ⚠️ Deprioritize or Rethink: Chat Feature

**Why:** WhatsApp/GroupMe are deeply entrenched. Hard to displace.

**Alternative Approach:**
- Don't build full chat - build **notifications** instead
- "Sarah added a stay for Jan 12-14" → Push notification
- "New expense added: Groceries $120" → Alert
- Link to existing chat apps instead of replacing them

**Save Development Time:** Focus on features WhatsApp can't do (expenses, weather, guest fees).

---

## Final Verdict: Is This Monetizable?

### YES - But With Caveats

**Realistic Revenue Potential:**
- **Year 1 (Beta):** $0-5,000 (focus on product-market fit)
- **Year 2 (Launch):** $15,000-30,000 (freemium + early sponsorships)
- **Year 3 (Scale):** $50,000-100,000 (scale to 2,000 houses)
- **Year 5 (Mature):** $200,000-500,000 (10,000 houses + partnerships)

**This is a lifestyle business, not a unicorn.** But that's okay!

**Best Case Scenario:**
- Become the default tool for 10,000+ ski house groups
- Generate $300,000-500,000/year in revenue
- Exit to a larger travel/outdoor company (Airbnb, REI, Outside magazine)

**Worst Case Scenario:**
- Struggle to reach critical mass within groups
- Free alternatives (spreadsheets + WhatsApp) win
- Seasonal usage kills retention
- Revenue stays below $10,000/year

---

## Path to Profitability

**Break-Even Analysis:**

**Costs:**
- Hosting (Supabase, Vercel): $50-200/month
- Email (Resend): $10-50/month
- Domain, SSL, misc: $20/month
- **Total Monthly Costs:** $80-270/month ($960-3,240/year)

**Revenue Needed to Break Even:**
- At $69/year per house: 14-47 paying houses
- At $8/month per house: 10-34 paying houses

**Time to Profitability:**
- With focused effort: 12-18 months
- Part-time/hobby effort: 24-36 months
